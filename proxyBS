sudo will not use all of the current environment values. Probably for security reasons. There are two possibilities how to overcome this:
Call sudo -E add-apt-repository <additional-options>

This will use all of the current environment.
You can configure sudo to automatically copy http_proxy and https_proxy too. Do this:

sudo visudo
Add the following lines:

Defaults env_keep +="http_proxy"
Defaults env_keep +="https_proxy"
